# Workout Workers
* This application seeks to build comradery by letting employees log their daily workouts while having other co-workers comment with words of encouragement. At the same time, the app provides a dose of healthy competition by announcing the most active employee of the week.

# Motivation 
* In today's complex work environment there are plenty of employees who have trouble fitting in physical exercise throughout their hectic week.  Therefore, this app aims to unite employees and motivate them to keep up with their essential physical activity.
